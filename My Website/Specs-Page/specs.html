    <h1>Specs</h1>
    <p>
      I was originally going to use this page to show the specs, but I did that
      in the Cost page instead. So I'll use this page to say this: <br />
      Since the unified memory and SSD storage can not be replaced after the
      iMac is purchased, it is vital that we pick the right amount. With the
      storage, I don't feel like paying an additional $200 for 256GB more of
      storage, because we can just buy an external SSD for a fraction of the
      price for much more storage.
      <br />
      <br />
      What is more important is the unified memory. As Apple says, 8GB (the
      standard) of unified memory is the equivalent of 16GB of ram on a PC.
      However, at this time (March 12, 2024), some things say that the base 8GB
      of unified memory is enough, other things say that you should rather go
      for the 16GB. For me, I think this comes down to: Do I have the money for
      16GB and am I using something / is my code powerful enough where it
      actually needs the extra memory?
